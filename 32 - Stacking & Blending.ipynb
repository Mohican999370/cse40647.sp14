      "Stacking (sometimes called stacked generalization or blending) involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs. In practice, a single-layer logistic regression model is often used as the combiner, although stacking can theoretically represent a variety of ensemble techniques by using any arbitrary combiner algorithm. Stacking/blending typically yields performance better than any single one of the trained models."

      "The concept of stacking requires that the base classifiers generate output that can be further processed by a higher-level classifier. To generate this output, the base classifiers must produce predictions on some sort of testing data. The base classifiers cannot use the original testing set, as these predictions will be used to train the higher-level classifier, and the original testing data should not be used to influence model training. Thus, the training set must itself be divided into training and testing portions for the base classifiers, which can be accomplished by cross-validation.\n",

      "Here, we use 5-fold cross-validation to partition the training set into five non-overlapping sets or folds. Note that the folds we generate are stratified, which means that each fold contains roughly the same proportion of each class label. On each iteration of cross-validation, one fold is used for validation while the remaining folds are used for training. The predictions generated by the base classifiers on the validation set are used as training features or predictor variables input to the higher-level classifier, while the predictions generated by the base classifiers on the original testing set are used as testing features or predictor variables input to the higher-level classifier. The labels (the class or target variable) remain the same. Thus, you can think of this process as replacing the original feature values for each instance by the predictions made by each classifier. By using cross-validation, we are able to use the original training portion of the dataset to both train and evaluate our base classifiers, which allows us to obtain predictions over (and thus generate new feature values for) all of the training instances. Since our higher-level classifier will be trained on these new feature values, we must also replace the original feature values for the testing data with the base model predictions on the testing data. As these preditions can be generated over the entire testing set on each fold, the average predictions over all folds are used as testing input to the higher-level model.\n",

This means that we use the outputs (predictions) from the base (level 0) classifiers as input to a higher-level (level 1) classifier. Here, we use logistic regression as the higher-level classifier. As a result, the output generated by the logistic regression model, which is trained or fit on the predictions of the lower-level models, is used to predict the target or class variable of interest."
